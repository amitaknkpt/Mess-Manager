It will be an Android application which will be useful for students to manage their daily mess/expenses, if they live in shared rooms or apartment.

This application should be able to register the mess members using their email id or phone number.

This application should be able to loas friends from facebook to add to the mess member.

If there are only one member, then this app should be able to keep track on his/her expenses.

There should be a concept of Admin system.

all of the mess member will act as an admin

when a member wnants to join the mess, the mess request should be forwarded to all current mess members

if all of the mess members accept the request. then he/she will be considered as a permanent mess member.

if his/her mess request is accepted by only one mess member, then he.she will be trated as an ad-hoc mess member.

if one of the permanent mess member wants to leave mess, then
   1. he/she have to make a LeaveMess request, that will be sent to all mess members except Ad-hoc members. And if all the mess member accepts the LeaveMess request, then he will completely leave the mess.
   2. But if anyone of the permanent mess members do not accept the LeaveMess request,  then he will be trated ad an Ad-hoc mess member.
